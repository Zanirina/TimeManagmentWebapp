                    <h3 id="l1">1. Pareto Analysis (a.k.a., the 80/20 rule)</h3>
                    <p>The 80/20 rule is a technique created by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It’s the idea
                        that 20% of actions are responsible for 80% of outcomes. The goal of Pareto analysis is to help
                        you prioritize tasks that are most effective at solving problems.</p>

                        <li><strong>List some of the problems you are facing.</strong> For example, maybe your grades
                            are slipping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify the root cause of each problem.</strong> Maybe your grades are slipping
                            because you spend
                            too much time on social media or any other sort of distraction.</li>
                        <li><strong> Assign a score to each problem:</strong> Assign higher numbers to more important
                            problems </li>
                        <li><strong>Group problems together by cause:</strong> Group together all the problems caused by

                        <li><strong>Add up the score of each group:</strong> The group with the highest score is the

                    <p>You can use our <a href="pomodoro.html">Pomodoro Timer</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Pomodoro Technique was created by entrepreneur and author Francesco Cirillo. This technique
                        uses a timer to break down your work into intervals. Each interval is known as a
                        <em>Pomodoro</em>, named
                        after the tomato-shaped timer that Cirillo created.
                    </p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <ol
                        class="border border-start border-top-0 border-end-0 border-bottom-0 border-success-subtle border-5">
                        <li><strong>Choose a task you need to get done.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Set a timer (e.g., for 25 mins).</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on the task at hand.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>When the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Take a short break:</strong> Take a break for about three to five minutes. Go for a
                            walk, grab a cup of coffee, do something non-work-related to give your brain a break.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repeat steps two to five:</strong>Once you have completed this process four times,
                            you can begin to take longer breaks (20–30 mins).</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The Pomodoro technique doesn’t just teach your time management; it also teaches you in setting
                        goals and how to achieve them. You’ll be able to better stick to your daily schedule and weekly
                        schedule.</p>

                    <h3 id="l3">3. Forest Timer: Stay Focused</h3>
                    <p>You can use our <a href="forestpage.html">Forest Timer</a>.</p>
                    <p>The Forest Timer is a focus-based productivity tool that helps you stay on track and avoid
                        distractions while working. The concept is simple: by planting a virtual tree, you commit to
                        focusing for a set period of time, and the tree grows as you work. If you stop timer the tree
                        will wither.</p>

                        <li><strong>Set your focus time (e.g., 25 minutes).</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Plant your tree and start working.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Stay focused:</strong> Avoid distractions like checking your phone or browsing the
                            internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>When the timer ends, your tree has grown!</strong></li>

                        <li>Anyone looking to build a habit of focused work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Forest Timer not only helps you stay focused, but also encourages you to build lasting
                        habits. By consistently using it, you’ll notice improvements in your concentration and the
                        ability to block out distractions. Plus, you’ll be rewarded with a virtual forest that grows as
                        your productivity thrives!</p>





                    <h3 id="l4">4. Eisenhower Matrix</h3>
                    <p>Before Dwight Eisenhower became president in 1953, he served in the U.S. Army as an Allied Forces
                        Commander during World War II. He was faced with difficult decisions every day that led him to
                        invent what is now called the <em>Eisenhower matrix</em>, or the <em>urgent-important
                            matrix</em>.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <p>Organize your task list into four separate quadrants, sorting them by important vs. unimportant
                        and urgent vs. not urgent, as shown in the graphic below. Urgent tasks are those we feel need to
                        get done immediately. Important tasks are those that contribute to your long term goals or
                        values. Ideally, you should only work on tasks in the top two quadrants—the other tasks, you
                        should delegate or delete.</p>

                    <h3 id="l5">5. Parkinson’s Law</h3>
                    <p>British historian Cyril Northcote Parkinson became famous for the phrase “work expands so as to
                        fill the time available for its completion.” In other words, the amount of time you give
                        yourself to complete a specific task is the amount of time it will take you to complete that
                        task.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <p>This is not a time management technique per se. It’s a law that, when understood, can be applied
                        as one of the most beneficial time management methods out there—but you will have to put in the
                        work. That means working more efficiently in shorter bursts of time. Here are some time
                        management tips:</p>

                        <li><strong>Try working without a computer charger.</strong> This will force you to finish a
                            project
                            before your computer dies. </li>
                        <li><strong>Get it done early. </strong>Instead of finishing an essay by midnight, try to get it
                            done by noon. </li>
                        <li><strong>Set a deadline. </strong>Give yourself a set time to do something—and then cut it in
                            half.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit time for tasks. </strong> Give yourself only 20 minutes in the morning to
                            answer emails.</li>

                    <p>Inventor Elon Musk is known for being productive. He manages his time so efficiently that he can
                        work over 80 hours a week and still make time for himself. What’s his secret? Time blocking.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <p>From the moment you wake up, assign each time block in your day to a task. These tasks can be
                        anything from eating breakfast to studying for a test. Below are the steps Elon Musk uses to
                        block his time: </p>

                        <li>Estimate the time it’s going to take to complete each of your tasks and fit them into your
                            time blocks. </li>
                        <li>Add buffer times in between each time block to allow for adjustments during the day.</li>

                    <h3 id="l7">7. Getting Things Done (GTD) Method</h3>
                    <p>Created by author David Allen, this process helps you get things done by recording tasks on paper
                        and then breaking them down into actionable work items.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <ol
                        class="border border-start border-top-0 border-end-0 border-bottom-0 border-success-subtle border-5">
                        <li><strong>Capture the actions that have your attention: </strong>These actions are tasks that
                            can
                            relate to anything from work to school to your personal life. </li>
                        <li><strong>Clarify what they mean: </strong>Decide whether the tasks that have your attention
                            are actionable or not. If an item is not actionable, ignore it for now. If the item is
                            actionable, do it, delegate it, or set it aside. </li>
                        <li><strong> Organize your actions: </strong>Prioritize your to do list according to what you
                            need to get done when.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflect: </strong> Review your list of actions frequently to determine your next
                            priority. Cross off tasks you have accomplished and update your list. </li>
                        <li><strong>Engage: </strong>Take the actions or smaller tasks you can complete right now.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Types of people who will benefit from the GTD method:</strong></p>

                        <li>People who struggle to focus on one thing at a time</li>
                        <li>People who feel overwhelmed in their daily lives</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3 id="l8">8. Rapid Planning Method (RPM)</h3>
                    <p>“RPM” stands for “rapid planning method” or “result, purpose, and massive action plan.” It was
                        developed by motivational speaker Tony Robbins as a way to train your brain to focus on a vision
                        of what you want so you can make it real.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <ol
                        class="border border-start border-top-0 border-end-0 border-bottom-0 border-success-subtle border-5">
                        <li><strong>Capturing: </strong>Write down all the tasks you need to accomplish this week. </li>
                        <li><strong>Chunking: </strong>“Chunk” your tasks together by commonalities. Which items are
                            personal? School-related? Career-focused? </li>
                        <li><strong> Create your own RPM blocks: </strong> On the top of a new sheet of paper, make
                            three columns: the task, the result you want from completing that task, and your purpose for
                            completing it. Next, list the actions you can take to get there.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create an empowering role for yourself: </strong> If you’re a student, you might
                            call yourself the “Study Queen.” Anything that will get you jazzed about completing your
                            goal.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 id="l9">9. Pickle Jar Theory</h3>
                    <p>This theory helps you figure out what is useful and what is not useful in your daily life. It
                        allows you to plan tasks with time to spare and set priorities for your day.</p>
                    <dt>How it works:</dt>
                    <p>Imagine a pickle jar full of sand, pebbles, and rocks. The sand is at the bottom and the rocks
                        sit at the top. </p>
                    <ol
                        class="border border-start border-top-0 border-end-0 border-bottom-0 border-success-subtle border-5">
                        <li><strong>The sand: </strong>This represents disrupting elements of your day, such as phone
                            calls, text messages, emails, social media, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>The pebbles: </strong>This represents tasks that need to be completed, but can be
                            done on another day or by someone else. </li>
                        <li><strong>The rocks: </strong> These are the most important tasks that need to get done today.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Begin by thinking about how your tasks for the day would fit into the above categories. Then make
                        a task list starting with the rocks and ending with sand (if time permits). Include an honest
                        time estimate next to each. Try not to plan more than six hours of an eight-hour working day.
                        This will leave buffer time for the pebbles and sand.</p>

                    <h2>Choosing a Time Management Technique That Works for You</h2>
                    <p>Whether you’re a full-time student, a working student or a parent going back to school, better
                        time management skills are vital to living a balanced life. If you have a habit of leaving
                        things until the last minute, try using Parkinson’s Law or the eat that frog method. If you have
                        a hard time focusing on the task at hand, try the Pomodoro technique of working more intensely
                        in short intervals.
